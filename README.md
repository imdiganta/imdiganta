<p>If you can tell about me in detail then I am a student.A few days ago, I passed my graduation with a side certificate.I started participating in programming because of my interest in programming since childhood.Through this online world, I get a chance to learn new things about different types of projects and model functions.Nothing much, just a beautiful life.Everything I have learned so far is of my own free will and interest.Generally took help from books and online in acquiring knowledge.I am a good personality person can speak some broken English and Hindi and Bengali very well.These have become more useful and convenient for me since entering the world of programming.I try to share everything I know about programming with timely and accurate information I have never published any project online before because I have not been connected with social for a long time. From 2024 onwards I will try to share all kinds of updates and new information with everyone. All my ideas and understanding about programming are described below through Gita Prepository. I want this world to be happy and beautiful.</p>
